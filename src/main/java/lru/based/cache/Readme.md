Design a cache library cache using the basic data structures.

Cache will be used by other components and applications (similar to any open source library you can download and use).

Requirements are:

1. Cache should be bounded in size.
2. Design it in a way so that it is easy to add a new eviction policy and data store to the library.
3. Users of the cache should be able to specify data store & eviction policy at initialization.
4. Provide one implementation of data store and eviction strategy.
